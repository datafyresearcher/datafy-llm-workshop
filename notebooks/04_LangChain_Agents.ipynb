Unlike chains, where the sequence of actions is hardcoded, agents use a language model as a reasoning engine to decide which actions to take and in what order. Agents are composed of several key components.\n","\n","**Agent:** This is the chain responsible for deciding the next step to take. It takes inputs such as available tools, user input, and any previously executed steps. The agent then returns either the next action to take or the final response to send to the user.\n","\n","**Tools:** Tools are functions that an agent calls to perform specific tasks. They are essential for the agent to accomplish its objective. LangChain provides a wide range of tools, and custom tools can also be defined.\n","\n","**Toolkits:** Toolkits are groups of tools needed to achieve specific objectives. They consist of 3-5 tools and are crucial for an agent to have access to the right set of tools.\n","\n","**AgentExecutor:** The agent executor is the runtime for an agent. It calls the agent and executes the actions it chooses. It handles complexities such as handling non-existent tools, tool errors, and logging.\n","\n","## Outline:\n","\n","* Using built in LangChain tools: DuckDuckGo search and Wikipedia\n","* Defining your own tools\n","* Pandas-df Agent\n","\n","https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/toolkits"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["if 'google.colab' in str(get_ipython()):\n","  print('Running on CoLab')\n","  # Install the package\n","  !pip install langchain openai litellm wikipedia -qU\n","else:\n","  print('Not running on CoLab')\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"sCtoRVgFITRD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1695943855219,"user_tz":-600,"elapsed":12703,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad Raza","userId":"10265348660845665358"}},"outputId":"66e98b07-59db-4a65-edee-d30949a89f18"},"id":"sCtoRVgFITRD","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m1.7/1.7 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m20.7 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m77.0/77.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m9.7 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m1.3/1.3 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m58.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m2.0/2.0 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m91.1 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m3.8/3.8 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m96.5 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m49.4/49.4 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m5.8 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m268.8/268.8 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m28.9 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#OpenAI API\n","\n","Let us try first using Openai API directly\n","\n","Read about the OpenAI API specifications and endpoints on below link\n","\n","https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference\n","\n","To learn about the available Models\n","\n","https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5"],"metadata":{"id":"x6y8N0PtIXLW"},"id":"x6y8N0PtIXLW"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"b7ed03ed-1322-49e3-b2a2-33e94fb592ef","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"b7ed03ed-1322-49e3-b2a2-33e94fb592ef"},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","import openai\n","\n","# select the model to use\n","llm_model = \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\"\n","\n","# openai.api_key = \"\"\n","\n","os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = \"\"\n","\n","# os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-litellm-7_NPZhMGxY2GoHC59LgbDw\" # [OPTIONAL] replace with your openai key"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"36fd0194-9f3d-4468-9390-f23df83e83c4","metadata":{"id":"36fd0194-9f3d-4468-9390-f23df83e83c4"},"source":["Note: LLM's do not always produce the same results.

Musk is the founder, chairman, CEO and chief technology officer of SpaceX;  angel investor, CEO, product architect and former chairman of Tesla, Inc.; owner, chairman and CTO of X Corp.; founder of the Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk Foundation. He is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$241 billion as of September 2023, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $261 billion according to Forbes, primarily from his ownership stakes in both Tesla and SpaceX.Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics there. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University. However, Musk dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999, and with $12 million of the money he made, that same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. \n","In 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, and that same year, with $100 million of the money he made, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company. In 2004, he became an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar-energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year, Musk co-founded Neuralink—a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces—and the Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion. He subsequently merged the company into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, he founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.\n","Musk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including spreading COVID-19 misinformation and promoting conspiracy theories. His Twitter ownership has been similarly controversial, including laying off a large number of employees, an increase in hate speech on the platform, and changes to Twitter Blue verification. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued him for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case, Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine.\n","\n","Page: Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk\n","Summary: Business magnate Elon Musk initiated an acquisition of American social media company Twitter, Inc. on April 14, 2022, and concluded it on October 27, 2022.

Musk promptly fired several top executives, including previous CEO Parag Agrawal. Musk has since proposed several reforms to Twitter and laid off half of the company's workforce. Hundreds of employees then resigned from the company after Musk issued an ultimatum demanding they commit to \"extremely hardcore\" work. Linda Yaccarino was appointed CEO of X Corp. in June 2023, and the Twitter app was rebranded as X.\n","Reactions to the buyout were mixed, with praise for Musk's planned reforms and vision for the company, particularly his calls for greater free speech, but criticism over fears of a potential rise in misinformation, disinformation, harassment, and hate speech on the platform. Within the United States, conservatives have largely supported the acquisition, while many liberals and former Twitter employees have voiced concerns about Musk's intentions. Since becoming owner, Musk has faced backlash for his handling of the company and account suspensions.\n","\n","Page: Elon Musk\n","Summary: Elon Reeve Musk ( EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate and investor. Musk is the founder, chairman, CEO and chief technology officer of SpaceX;  angel investor, CEO, product architect and former chairman of Tesla, Inc.; owner, chairman and CTO of X Corp.; founder of the Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk Foundation. He is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$241 billion as of September 2023, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $261 billion according to Forbes, primarily from his ownership stakes in both Tesla and SpaceX.Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics there. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University. However, Musk dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999, and with $12 million of the money he made, that same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. \n","In 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, and that same year, with $100 million of the money he made, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight
