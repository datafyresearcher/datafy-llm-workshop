It uses an LLM (Large Language Model) to extract information on entities and builds up its knowledge about those entities over time. The memory component includes short-term memory for in-context learning and long-term memory for retaining and recalling information over extended periods. It can be used to store facts and details about entities mentioned in the conversation, allowing the language model to provide more accurate and relevant responses. The ConversationEntityMemory class in the Langchain library provides functionality for implementing entity memory in a conversation.\n","\n","## Outline\n","* ConversationBufferMemory\n","* ConversationBufferWindowMemory\n","* ConversationTokenBufferMemory\n","* ConversationSummaryMemory\n","\n","https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/memory\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"j5IyRc7RRpPC","metadata":{"id":"j5IyRc7RRpPC"},"outputs":[],"source":["if 'google.colab' in str(get_ipython()):\n","  print('Running on CoLab')\n","  # Install the package\n","  !pip install openai-qU\n","  !pip install langchain tiktoken -qU\n","\n","else:\n","  print('Not running on CoLab')\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"jrukJEw2RtLt","metadata":{"id":"jrukJEw2RtLt"},"source":["#OpenAI API\n","\n","Let us try first using Openai API directly\n","\n","Read about the OpenAI API specifications and endpoints on below link\n","\n","https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference\n","\n","To learn about the available Models\n","\n","https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"1nILzxxVRxxv","metadata":{"id":"1nILzxxVRxxv"},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","# import openai\n","\n","# select the model to use\n","llm_model = \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\"\n","\n","# openai.api_key = \"\"\n","\n","os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = \"sk-M7uNHfnsgIMQc5WZ4uV0T3BlbkFJnDXQTey*******\"\n","\n","# os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-litellm-7_NPZhMGxY2GoHC59LgbDw\" # [OPTIONAL] replace with your openai key"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1297dcd5","metadata":{"id":"1297dcd5"},"source":["## ConversationBufferMemory"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"20ad6fe2","metadata":{"id":"20ad6fe2","tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\n","from langchain.chains import ConversationChain\n","from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"88bdf13d","metadata":{"id":"88bdf13d","tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0, model=llm_model)\n","memory = ConversationBufferMemory()\n","conversation = ConversationChain(\n","    llm=llm,\n","    memory = memory,\n","    verbose=True\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"db24677d","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":268},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1870,"status":"ok","timestamp":1704180970419,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad Raza","userId":"10265348660845665358"},"user_tz":-300},"id":"db24677d","outputId":"9a773716-1fc3-4d20-e936-1addf0e31b65","tags":[]},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","\n","\u001b[1m> Entering new ConversationChain chain...\u001b[0m\n","Prompt after formatting:\n","\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI.
